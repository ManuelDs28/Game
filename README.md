Hi everyone
This is my first proyect since I started the Bootcamp!
I hope you like it.
The game it's made with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The game is inspired by the game called Brick Breaker.
In case you don't know what the game is about here is a little resume:
In this game, the player moves a PADDLE from side-to-side to hit a BALL. The game’s objective is to eliminate
all of the BRICKS at the top of the screen by hitting them with the BALL.

Peace out✌️
